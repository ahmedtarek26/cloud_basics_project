# Introduction

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Evaluate and compare performance of VMs vs. containers
- **Resource Constraints**: 
  - 2 CPU cores
  - 2GB RAM
  - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Testing Tools**: HPL, stress-ng, sysbench, IOZone, iperf

## Testing Methodology

- **Identical Resource Allocation** for fair comparison
- **Comprehensive Benchmarking** across multiple dimensions:
  - CPU Performance
  - Memory Performance
  - Disk I/O Performance
  - Network Performance
- **Standardized Testing Environment** for reproducible results

# Performance Test Results

## Memory Performance

![Memory Performance Comparison](visualizations/memory_comparison.png)

- Container memory throughput: **4500.59 MiB/sec**
- VM memory throughput: **4440.04 MiB/sec**
- Containers show **1.36% better** memory performance

## Network Bandwidth

![Network Bandwidth Comparison](visualizations/network_bandwidth_comparison.png)

- Container bandwidth: **980 Mbits/sec**
- VM bandwidth: **940 Mbits/sec**
- Containers show **4.26% better** network bandwidth

## Network Jitter

![Network Jitter Comparison](visualizations/network_jitter_comparison.png)

- Container jitter: **0.052 ms**
- VM jitter: **0.089 ms**
- Containers show **41.57% lower** network jitter (better)

## VM IOZone Write Performance

![VM IOZone Write Performance](visualizations/vm_iozone_write_perf.png)

- Performance varies by file size and record size
- Best performance with small record sizes and large file sizes

## Container IOZone Write Performance

![Container IOZone Write Performance](visualizations/container_iozone_write_perf.png)

- Generally higher performance than VMs
- Similar pattern of performance variation by file/record size

## IOZone Performance Difference

![IOZone Performance Difference](visualizations/iozone_performance_diff.png)

- Green areas: Containers outperform VMs
- Red areas: VMs outperform containers
- Performance difference ranges from -10% to +20%

# Analysis and Recommendations

## Performance Comparison Summary

| Metric | VM | Container | Difference | Better |
|--------|-----|-----------|------------|--------|
| Memory (MiB/sec) | 4440.04 | 4500.59 | +1.36% | Container |
| Network (Mbits/sec) | 940 | 980 | +4.26% | Container |
| Jitter (ms) | 0.089 | 0.052 | -41.57% | Container |
| Disk I/O | Baseline | +5-15% | +5-15% | Container |

## Virtualization Overhead Analysis

- **VMs**: Full hardware virtualization with hypervisor
  - Additional overhead for memory management
  - I/O operations pass through more layers
  - CPU context switching overhead

- **Containers**: Share host kernel, use lightweight isolation
  - Near-native performance
  - Minimal overhead
  - Direct access to kernel subsystems

## Use Case Recommendations

- **Memory-intensive applications**: Slight advantage for containers

- **Network-intensive applications**: Significant advantage for containers
  - Higher bandwidth
  - Lower jitter
  - Ideal for microservices, web applications

- **I/O-intensive applications**: General advantage for containers
  - Better for databases and file-serving applications

- **Security-sensitive applications**: VMs may be preferred
  - Stronger isolation despite performance trade-offs

# Conclusion

## Key Findings

- Containers outperform VMs in most performance metrics
- Most significant advantage in network performance (41.57% lower jitter)
- Modest advantages in memory throughput and disk I/O
- Results align with industry expectations

## Future Work

- Test with different resource allocations
- Evaluate performance under varying workloads
- Compare different container technologies
- Investigate performance with clustered deployments
